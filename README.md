## How it works?
1. **Throw the garbage**
    - Dispense the wrapper of the product into the Smart Dustbin
    - The Smart Dustbin reads the RFID Tag in the wrapper and updates it into the firebase cloud

2. **Updates in cloud**
    - A New Entry is for the product is made against the particular user in Firebase Real time Database
    - The Firebase responds with the type of waste generated by the product.
    - This responded data is used in smart disposal by categorizing the product into biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>List Of Users and the products in cart</th>            
            <th>List Of Products and their details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="SCREENSHOT/usersList.png?raw=true" height="400"></td>            
            <td><img src="SCREENSHOT/productList.png?raw=true" height="400"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


3. **Front end application**
    - Every item thrown is further shown in the front end applications with facilities to add, delete and modify items.
    - Every item is categorized and available suggestions are displayed alongside the percentage of saving and additional expenses incurred
    
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>List of items in the cart</th>
            <th>Suggestive Cart</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="SCREENSHOT/products.png?raw=true" height="400"></td>
            <td><img src="SCREENSHOT/swapItems.png?raw=true" height="400"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

4. **Analytics for the best offers**
    - The Vendors are provided with a platform to analyze the buying patterns of the customers.
    - The Analysis works based on Apriori Algorithm where in the most frequently bought items are grouped together based on threshold values of Support and Confidence to generate rules.
    - This Rules are further subjected to the discretion of the vendor to make offers
